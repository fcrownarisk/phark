Here is a simple framework to accomplish some basic Arknight - like game logic:

I. Character Class

Attributes
Health: Represents the character's remaining health. For example, an operator might start with 1000 health points.
Attack Power: Determines the damage the character can deal. A sniper operator could have a high attack power like 500.
Defense: Reduces the damage taken. A tank - type character might have a defense of 300.
Range: Defines the area in which the character can attack. A melee operator has a short range, say 1 tile in front of them, while a ranged operator can attack from a distance, like 3 - 5 tiles away.
Skills
Active Skills: These are skills that the player can activate. For example, a healer might have a skill that restores a large amount of health to all allies in a certain area. The skill could have a cooldown period, say 10 seconds.
Passive Skills: Skills that are always active. A character might have a passive skill that increases its attack power by 20% when it is adjacent to another friendly character.
II. Level Design

Maps
Tiles: The game map is made up of tiles. Some tiles might be normal ground tiles, while others could be special tiles like high - ground tiles that give ranged operators an advantage in attack range.
Obstacles: There could be obstacles on the map such as walls or crates. Walls can block the movement and line - of - sight of characters, while crates can be destroyed to reveal hidden paths or items.
Enemy Waves
Wave Composition: Each wave of enemies could consist of different types of enemies. For example, one wave might have mostly melee enemies at the beginning, followed by a few ranged enemies and a boss enemy at the end.
Spawn Points: These are the locations on the map where enemies spawn. There could be multiple spawn points, and the spawn pattern could vary from level to level.
III. Combat System

Turn - Based or Real - Time
In a turn - based system, each character gets a turn to move and attack. The order of turns could be determined by the character's speed attribute. In a real - time system, characters can move and attack continuously as long as they meet the requirements (such as having enough action points).
Action Points (if applicable)
Characters are allocated a certain number of action points per turn. Moving a certain distance and using skills consume action points. For example, moving one tile might cost 1 action point, and using a basic attack might cost 2 action points.
IV. Resource Management

Currency
The game could have a currency system, like LMD (in Arknights). Currency can be used to recruit new characters, upgrade existing characters, or build facilities in the base.
Materials
Materials are used for character upgrades. Different materials are required for different levels of upgrades. For example, a character might need 10 pieces of a certain material to upgrade from level 1 to level 2.
This is just a basic framework, and a full - fledged Arknight - like game would require much more detailed design, including graphics, sound, and a more complex balance system.
